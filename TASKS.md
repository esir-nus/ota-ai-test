- [x] Set up systemd service configuration for automatic startup
- [x] Implement logging system (with rotation and proper error handling)
- [x] Create configuration management module (`/etc/ota_config.json`)
- [x] Implement device identification system (generate and store SHA256 hash of MAC address in `/etc/device_id`)

## 2. Networking & Communication
- [x] Implement network availability detection
- [x] Develop network quality validation metrics
- [x] Create OTA server communication module (HTTP/HTTPS client)
- [x] Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism for failed connections
- [x] Design and implement data transfer protocol with checksum verification

## 3. Check & Preparation Phase
- [x] Implement scheduled task system (checking at 3 AM, 4 AM, 5 AM)
- [x] Create manifest fetching and parsing module
- [x] Implement version comparison logic for update detection
- [x] Design notification flag system and release notes storage
- [x] Add integrity verification for downloaded manifests

## 4. User Notification System
- [x] Create interface with main robot-ai GUI for update notifications
- [x] Implement pop-up display mechanism for the projector
- [x] Design severity classification display (critical, regular updates)
- [x] Create voice command detection integration with Qwen transcription

## 5. Decision & Scheduling Phase
- [x] Implement voice command parsing for "Install Tonight"
- [x] Create confirmation display UI integration
- [x] Develop update scheduling system with task persistence
- [x] Implement pre-update check system (disk space, network stability)

## 6. Backup & Update Execution
- [x] Create system backup module with compression
- [x] Implement backup rotation and retention policy (keep latest 2 backups)
- [x] Design peripheral disabling mechanism (mic, speaker, projector)
- [x] Create update package download and verification system
- [ ] Implement incremental update support if possible

## 7. Installation & Validation
- [x] Implement safe update application procedure
- [x] Create system integrity validation post-update
- [x] Implement service restart mechanism

## 8. Rollback Mechanisms
- [x] Implement automatic failure detection with specific criteria
- [x] Create voice-commanded rollback system
- [x] Design confirmation UI for rollback operations
- [x] Implement backup restoration procedure
- [x] Add post-rollback validation and notification

## 9. Testing & Integration
- [ ] Create unit tests for each component
- [ ] Develop integration tests with mock update server
