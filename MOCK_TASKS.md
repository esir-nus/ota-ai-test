# OTA Simulation Environment Tasks

## 1. Local Server Infrastructure
- [x] Set up basic HTTP server for mock update server (using Flask)
- [x] Create configuration system for server endpoints and behavior
- [ ] Add support for simulated network conditions (latency, packet loss)
- [x] Implement basic logging for all server interactions
- [x] Add endpoints for connectivity testing

## 2. Update Package Generation
- [x] Create script to generate test update packages with version information
- [x] Implement manifest generation with configurable metadata
- [x] Add support for generating valid/invalid checksums for testing
- [ ] Create various package types (full, incremental, configuration-only)
- [x] Generate test packages with different severity levels
- [x] Create GUI interface for easier package generation
- [x] Implement command-line fallback for GUI operation
- [x] Create diagnostic tools for application troubleshooting
- [x] Add rich manifest data for GUI testing

## 3. GitHub Integration
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository for package hosting
- [ ] Create release workflow for package publishing
- [ ] Implement automated release notes generation
- [ ] Set up version tagging system
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for automated package validation

## 4. Simulation Controller
- [ ] Develop basic CLI for controlling the simulation environment
- [x] Implement commands to start/stop mock update server
- [ ] Add support for scenario execution (pre-defined test cases)
- [ ] Create command to generate status reports of running simulations
- [ ] Implement clean shutdown and resource cleanup

## 5. Test Scenarios
- [x] Create successful update scenario (happy path)
- [ ] Implement network failure during download scenario
- [ ] Add server unavailability simulation
- [ ] Implement checksum verification failure scenario

## 6. Monitoring & Analysis
- [x] Implement logging for all simulation components
- [ ] Create simple dashboard for visualizing update progress
- [ ] Add metrics collection (timing, success rates, etc.)
- [ ] Implement export of simulation results for analysis
- [ ] Create visualization of communication flow between components

## 7. Integration with OTA Daemon
- [x] Add configuration option in daemon to use local simulation servers
- [x] Implement seamless switching between production and simulation modes
- [x] Create test utility to verify daemon-simulation connectivity
- [x] Ensure all daemon features work with mock environment
- [x] Add simulation environment detection to prevent accidental production use
- [x] Test manifest display functionality in GUI
- [x] Verify connectivity check integration with GUI

## 8. Documentation
- [x] Write setup guide for simulation environment
- [ ] Document available test scenarios
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common simulation issues
- [ ] Add examples of extending the simulation with new scenarios
- [ ] Document integration points with the main OTA daemon
- [ ] Add GitHub release process documentation
